			<h2>Get to know me</h2>
			<p>Hello and welcome to the Bakedbyalyssaaa website! My name is Alyssa and I have been baking since I was about 7 or 8 years old. My grandma was actually the person who gave me inspiration to start making desserts. She was a baker and cake decorator for her own business, and from spending my summers with her my love for baking grew. Over the years I’ve followed my passion of dessert making, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakedbyalyssaaa?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" target="_blank">BakedbyAlyssaaa</a> being born in 2021 when I was 17! <br><br>As a very busy and involved high school student who also had a job, baking became an outlet for me to leave behind the stress of school and work for a few hours. Walking around school and hearing “that’s the baker” from people I didn’t even know was truly the greatest feeling. I was recognized for my baking not on just the student level, but I also had staff who would order too! Little by little business started to pick up and then somehow along the way just completely took off, bringing us here.<br><br> Looking back now as I’m only months away from my university graduation, I would have never expected for my dreams to come true the way that they have. Having my own business was always something I wished for, and with all the continuous support and love that is shown, it has been made possible. All the countless nights of veeeery little or no sleep, days where I had to bake after going to school in the morning and work in the afternoon, breakdowns when orders aren’t coming out right, and so much more have been completely worth it. There is no greater joy than knowing people actually enjoy my desserts and that’s what keeps me going. Bakedbyalyssaaa would be nothing without those who have supported me along the way.<br><br> Thank you for taking a moment to look around my website. I look forward to making something delicious for you!</p>
